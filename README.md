# CompAstro_2024
This python notebook consists of a project completed for a Computational Astrophysics course at University of Amsterdam. The task was to model the central parts of a Sun-like star, including both radiative and convective energy transport, utilizing ordinary differential equations. Essentially, this project aims to recreate a snapshot of the calculations performed in the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/) package, an open-source 1D stellar evolution code.
